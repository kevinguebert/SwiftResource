#Swift Resources

While learning Swift, I decided to try and put together a simple application that turned the repository [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios) into a simple application. 

The first version used a basic API built off of Heroku, but then Firebase came out during the time I was building it and I decided to switch to that.

**Work in Progress.**
